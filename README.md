Agent Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and references that coding agents load when a task needs them. The skills in this repository give agents such as Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and OpenCode the know-how to work with Edge Impulse: the Studio and Ingestion APIs, firmware for Arduino, STM32, Zephyr, and Raspberry Pi, and custom blocks.

Every skill follows the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification), and every skill name starts with `ei-` so it's easy to spot next to skills from other catalogs.

## Quick start

Install the whole catalog with the [`skills`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/skills) CLI. You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and Git.

```bash
npx skills add edgeimpulse/agent-tools
```

Then ask your agent for something like:

- "Deploy my Edge Impulse model to an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense and print the predictions over serial."
- "Write a Python script that uploads every WAV file in this folder to my Edge Impulse project."
- "Run my object detection model on a Raspberry Pi camera feed."
- "Scaffold a custom learning block that trains a PyTorch model."

Your agent picks the right skill from its description and loads it automatically.

## Available skills

Stable skills are ready for everyday use. Experimental skills are newer, may change, and we'd love your feedback on them.

### Platform and APIs

| Skill | Status | What it does |

| [`ei-build-custom-synthetic-data-blocks`](skills/.experimental/ei-build-custom-synthetic-data-blocks) | Experimental | Generate samples and upload them through the Ingestion API |

## Installation

The [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI from Vercel installs skills for [many coding agents](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills#supported-agents), including Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and OpenCode.

```bash
# See what's available without installing anything
npx skills add edgeimpulse/agent-tools --list

# Pick skills and agents interactively
npx skills add edgeimpulse/agent-tools

# Install specific skills by name
npx skills add edgeimpulse/agent-tools --skill ei-api --skill ei-firmware-arduino

# Install the whole catalog to every detected agent, no prompts
npx skills add edgeimpulse/agent-tools --all

# Install the whole catalog, but choose the agents yourself
npx skills add edgeimpulse/agent-tools --skill '*' --agent claude-code --yes
```

Experimental skills appear alongside stable ones in all of these. Use `--agent` to target specific agents and `--yes` to skip the prompts in CI.

<details>
<summary><strong>Project or global scope</strong></summary>

Everything installs into the current project unless you pass `-g`:

| Scope | Flag | Installed to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project (default) | none | `./<agent>/skills/` in the current directory |
| Global | `-g`, `--global` | `~/<agent>/skills/` in your home directory |

```bash
npx skills add edgeimpulse/agent-tools --skill ei-api --global --agent claude-code --yes
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>List, update, and remove skills</strong></summary>

```bash
# Show the skills you have installed
npx skills list

# Update installed skills to the latest version in this repository
npx skills update ei-api

# Remove a skill (add --global if you installed it globally)
npx skills remove ei-api
```

Run `npx skills remove` with no arguments to pick from the installed skills interactively.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Try a skill without installing it</strong></summary>

```bash
npx skills use edgeimpulse/agent-tools@ei-api --agent claude-code
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Upgrading from unprefixed names</strong></summary>

Skills in this catalog were previously published without the `ei-` prefix (`api`, `firmware-arduino`, and so on). `npx skills update` doesn't rename an installed skill, so remove the old copy and install the prefixed one:

```bash
npx skills remove api
npx skills add edgeimpulse/agent-tools --skill ei-api
```

</details>

## How this repository works

### Catalog lifecycle

The lifecycle directories are repository conventions, not Agent Skills frontmatter fields:

| Directory | Lifecycle | What to expect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `skills/` | Stable | Backwards compatibility is expected. |
| `skills/.experimental/` | Experimental | May change or be removed. Suitable for early adopters and feedback. |
| `skills/.deprecated/` | Deprecated | Kept for existing users. Don't build on these. |

### Skill versions

Each `SKILL.md` stores a semantic version in `metadata.version`. Stable skills start at `1.0.0`, and experimental skills start at `0.1.0`.

After a push to `main`, the version workflow increments the patch version once for every skill with changed files and opens a pull request with those bumps. Changes outside a skill directory don't affect skill versions, and merging a generated version-bump pull request doesn't trigger another bump.

## Contributing

We welcome bug reports, fixes, and new skills.
